        If you're a **Lead Developer**... or a **Product Owner**...

        ... and *especially* if you're a **CTO** or **Business Owner**...

        ... I'd be surprised if you're 100% happy.

        It's not Inevitable. Some teams have figured it out. Software Development can be an efficient and effective process.

        Development can pay.

        My name is Gary Straughan. I’m a software developer. But unlike most developers, I come from a business
        background: for the best part of a decade I was a B2B Marketing Manager for a multi-national.

        In 1999 I left it all behind and joined a “DotCom”.

        After a spell as a Business Analyst, I re-discovered a love for writing code.

        For the next few years, it was all about the code. I was driven to learn everything I could.

        But my inner business guy couldn’t be silenced.

        it got to a point where great code was no longer enough.

        I needed to see RESULTS.

        So I started to take notice.

        I started to pay attention... to things that worked well... and to things that got in the way.

        And that’s what **Development** That Pays is all about.

        It’s the Good the Bad and the Ugly that I’ve witnessed first hand from inside the development teams of some well-known companies.

        So join me for Development That Pays.

        Each week - in 5 minutes or less -  I’ll share with you an aspect of software development.

        NOT the *technicalities* of writing code, but the *practicalities* of what it takes to create profitable software.

        If you’ve ever wondered how things are done at the **The Economist** or the **BBC**, you won’t want to
        miss an episode.

        As a Software Engineer, I love to write good quality code.

        But as a former Marketing Manager, I know that there are things that are far more important.

        In this video, I share with you one of my fundamental beliefs about *PROFITABLE* software development:

        It's more important to *build the right thing* than to *build it right*.

        Enjoy the video.

        Hi this is Gary Straughan

        Welcome to Development That Pays.

        As a Software Engineer, I love to write good quality code.

        But as a former Marketing Manager, I know that there are things that are far more important.

        Today I want to share with you one of my fundamental beliefs about PROFITABLE software development.

        This is the tale of

        two walls

        and two ladders.

        The ladder on the left is

        Well-designed.

        Well-made.

        It’s beautifully piece of engineering.

        The ladder on the right is

        much more basic.

        it’s nothing more than a few bits of wood nailed together.

        Which of the two ladders is better?

        Clearly, the one on the left.

        HOWEVER...

        It’s important to realise that the key VALUE of a  ladder...

        is not what it IS

        but rather what it DOES.

        What a ladder DOES is get us from one level to another.

        In this case, from point A to point B.

        Which of the two ladders is better?

        The ladder on the left is a better LADDER.

        But both ladders serve roughly the same PURPOSE:

        Both ladders get us from point A to point B.

        Let’s take this one step further.

        Notice that each ladder takes us to a DIFFERENT point B.

        From the evidence in front of us,

          “point B” on the left looks very much like

          “point B” on the right.

        What we’re here missing is the BIGGER PICTURE.

        So let’s take a look at a “bigger picture”.

        That changes everything.

        The beautifully-constructed ladder turns out to be

        an expensive shortcut

        to certain death!

        The rough-and-ready home-made ladder

        turns out to be a cost-effective shortcut to

        untold riches.

        Which of the two ladders is better?

        The well-designed, well-constructed ladder is still a better LADDER

        … but the home-made ladder has provided us with far more VALUE.

        What’s the moral of this story?

        it’s that code - just like a ladder - is a MEANS TO AN END.

        It can be elegant. It can be well-crafted.

        But these things count for nothing…

        ... if the code doesn’t achieve a real business goal.

        Picking the right “wall” is more important than building the perfect “ladder”.

        Put it another way:

        It’s more important to build the right thing

        than to build the thing right.

        Of course, “picking the right thing” is easier said than done.

        We’ll be taking at how to do that in future episodes.

        Talk to you next time.
